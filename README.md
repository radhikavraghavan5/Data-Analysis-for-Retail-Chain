## Overview
KPMG is a global organization of independent professional firms that provides a range of services to organizations across various industries, government, and non-profit sectors. Its service areas include Audit, Assurance & Risk Consulting; Deals, Tax & Legal; Management Consulting; and Innovation & Digital Solutions.

Under the KPMG Digital Solutions service, as part of the Data, Analytics & Modeling team, we will effectively analyze data sets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a bike and bike accessories company, develop and optimize its marketing strategies.

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer demographics
Customer addresses
Transactions

## ðŸ“‚ Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment
### Background Information
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

"The importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth."

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
- Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months

### Objectives
Review and evaluate the data based on Standard Data Quality Dimensions.
Identify strategies to mitigate that issues.

### Results

| Table Name  |  	No of Records | Distinct customer_id  |  Date Data Recieved |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| CustomerDemographic | 4000 | 4000 |  2022-12-20  |    
| CustomerAddres| 	3999	| 3999	| 2022-12-20 | 
| Transactions	| 20001	| 3494	| 2022-12-20 | 

#### 1. Accuracy : correct values
There are several columns with values that are inaccurate with the existing dataset.

In CustomerDemographic, DOB is less able to provide insight into the dataset. From this, DOB has been converted to a new column Age.
In Transactions, the values of product_first_sold date have Unix timestamp format. It has been converted to a general timestamp.

#### 2. Completeness : data field with values
Various columns have empty or missing values in certain records.

In CustomerDemographic, the total percentage of missing values reaches 30% with the columns that have the highest percentage of job_industry_category and job_title. Based on the categorical data type and the distribution of values in each column, they have been filled with the previous value.
In Transactions, the percentage of missing values is only 2.78%. These records are still safe to remove from the dataset, as they do not significantly affect the analysis or modeling results.

#### 3. Consistency : value free from contradiction
There are inconsistent datatypes and values for the same column.

- Datatype: Remove unwanted characters and change the datatype (e.g. object to numeric). Make sure that the same column in different tables has the same datatype.
- DOB, transaction_date is recommended to be datetime.
- transaction_id, product_id, customer_id, product_first_sold_date is recommended to be integer.
- standard_cost is recommended to be float.
- Values: Replace the inconsistent value that has the least frequency of expression.
- Column gender in the CustomerDemographics - "F", "Femel", to "Female"; "M" to "Male".
- Column state in the CustomerAddress - "New South Wales" to "NSW", "Victoria" to "VIC".

#### 4. Currency : value up to date
In deceased_indicator, CustomerDemographic table, value "Y" ware not current customers and has been deleted because we want only live customers.

#### 5. Relevancy : data items with value meta-data
The default in the CustomerDemographic and Unnamed: 13 to Unnamed: 23 in the Transaction table are columns that have no relevance to the dataset. They should be deleted.
In CustomerDemographic, the "U" values in gender are not known what they represent. So they have been replaced based on the data distribution, "Male".

#### 6. Validity : data containing allowable values
In the Transaction table, standard_cost has a value that does not match the format and inconsistent data entry. Remove unwanted characters and change the datatype accordingly.
There are some records in product_id = 0, we can make sure and check the database if there is 0 is a number code of product.

#### 7. Uniqueness : record that are duplicated
No duplicate records

## ðŸ“‚ Task 2 - Data Insights
### Background Information
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour. Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, we will recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

### Objective
- Built customer segmentations
- Analyzing customer trends, behaviour, and demographic

### Result
#### Customersâ€™ age distribution
- As we can see, mostly our new customers are between 25 to 48 years old.
- Number of customers from 48 to 59 years old has big drops on percentages.
- There is a slightly increase in number of customers over 59 years old in term of percentages
- It looks like the percentages of under 25 years old not really change.

#### Number of bike purchases in 3 years / percentages purchases
- As we can see, our new customers mostly Female with 50.6% purchases with total of 25,212 bikes
- Male contributed to 47.7% purchases with 23,765 bikes. 
- So we should focus on advertises on Female customers than Male customers

#### Job industry category
- Mostly our new customers are on Finance industry and our Manufacturing customers are still on top 2. The rest industries is still same

#### Wealth segments
- In all ages, the number of Mass Customers is the highest so we should focus on this social class.
- After that, we should focus on High Net Customer. Then Affluent Customers but mostly second and third quadrant

#### Numbers of cars owned on each state
- NSW should be considered the most since numbers of customers donâ€™t own cars is significantly larger than that own.
- VIC and QLD has more customers that own car that who donâ€™t but we can try to have something so that those owns car will buy bikes.

## ðŸ“‚ Task 3 - Data Insights and Presentation

### Background Information
After building the model we need to present our results back to the client. A list of customers or algorithm wonâ€™t cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualisations.

### Objective
To develop a dashboard
